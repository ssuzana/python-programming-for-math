Typically a function will receive some data as *input*, will perform an *algorithm* involving the input data, and will *output* data when the algorithm terminates.  \n",

As an application of these techniques, we implement the Euclidean algorithm as a Python function in a few ways, to effectively find the GCD of integers.\n",

After the function name `square` comes parentheses `(x)` containing the **argument** `x`.  The *arguments* or *parameters* of a function refer to the input data.  Even if your function has no arguments, you need parentheses.  The argument `x` is used to name whatever number is input into the `square` function.  \n",

So when you apply the function with the command `square(1.5)`, the number `1.5` is `passed` as the argument `x`, and `answer` is `2.25`, and that number `2.25` becomes the output."

The body of the function uses the **control statement** `if n%2 == 0:`.  Recall that `n%2` gives the remainder after dividing `n` by `2`.  Thus `n%2` is 0 or 1, depending on whether `n` is even or odd.  Therefore the **boolean** `n%2 == 0` is `True` if `n` is even, and `False` if `n` is odd.\n",

It just remembers the endpoints, and how to proceed from one number to the next.  In the older version, Python 2.x, the range command `range(2,n)` would have tried to store the entire list of numbers `[2,3,4,...,n-1]` in the memory of your computer.  Your computer has some (4 or 8 or 16, perhaps) gigabytes of memory (RAM).  A gigabyte is a billion bytes, and a byte is enough memory to store a number between 0 and 255.  (More detail about this later!).  So a gigabyte will not even hold a billion numbers.  So our `is_prime` function would have led to memory problems in Python 2.x, but in Python 3.x we don't have to worry (for now) about space."

    "This code is essentially optimal, if one wishes to execute the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD of two integers.  It almost [matches the GCD code in a standard Python library](https://stackoverflow.com/a/18944210).  It might be slightly faster than our original code -- but there is a tradeoff here between execution speed and readability of code.  In this and the following lessons, we often optimize enough for everyday purposes, but not so much that readability is lost."

    "## Exercises and explorations\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  What are the signals of scope in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  Write a function called area_circle, which takes one argument radius. The function should return the area of the circle, as a floating point number. Then add one line to the function, using string formatting, so that it additionally prints a helpful sentence of the form \"The area of a circle of radius 1.0 is 3.14159.\" (depending on the radius and the area it computes).\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  Write a function called factorial, which takes one argument called `n`.  The function should return the factorian of `n` when `n` is a positive integer.  Don't worry about what happens when `n` is zero, or a bad input.  Don't use recursion (if you know it) -- just use a for loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. `format` is an example of a \"string method\".  Another neat one is `replace`.  Try `\"Python\".replace(\"yth\",\"arag\")` to see what it does.  \n",
    "\n",
    "5.  Try the formatting codes `%` and `E` (instead of `f`) for a floating point number.  What do they do?\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Can you think of a reason you might want to have a function with *no* arguments?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Create a function `my_abs(x)` which outputs the absolute value of the argument `x`.  (Note that Python already has a built-in `abs(x)` function).  \n",
    "\n",
    "2.  Modify the `is_prime` function so that it prints a message `Number too big` and returns `None` if the input argument is bigger than one million.  (Note that `None` is a Python reserved word.  You can use the one-line statement `return None`.)  \n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    def is_prime(n):\n",
    "        '''\n",
    "        Checks whether the argument n is a prime number.\n",
    "        Uses a brute force search for factors between 1 and n.\n",
    "        '''\n",
    "        for j in range(2,n):  # the list of numbers 2,3,...,n-1.\n",
    "            if n%j == 0:  # is n divisible by j?\n",
    "                print(f\"{j} is a factor of {n}.\")\n",
    "                return False\n",
    "        return True\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  There's a special exception called `ZeroDivisionError`.  When do you think this occurs?  Try to make it occur!  Can you think of a time when you might want to raise this exception yourself?\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  Make the `is_prime` function from Exercise 8 safer by raising a `TypeError` or a `ValueError` when a \"bad\" input occurs.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Modify the `is_prime` function from Exercise 8 by using a while loop instead of `for j in range(2,n):`.  Hint:  the function should contain the lines `j = 2` and `while j < n:` and `j = j + 1` in various places.  Why might this be an improvement from the for loop?  Can you look for factors within a smaller range?\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  Write a Python function `thrarity` which takes an argument `n`, and outputs the string `threeven` if `n` is a multiple of three, or `throdd` is `n` is one more than a multiple of three, or `thrugly` if `n` is one less than a multiple of three.  Example:  `thrarity(31)` should output `throdd` and `thrarity(44)` should output `thrugly`.  Hint:  study the `if`/`elif` syntax at [the official Python tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#if-statements).\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  Write a Python function `sum_of_squares(n)` which finds and prints a pair of natural numbers $x$, $y$, such that $x^2 + y^2 = n$.  The function should use a brute force search and return `None` if no such pair of numbers $x,y$ exists.  Explore which natural numbers can be expressed as sums of two squares. Hint:  look at prime numbers first!\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  Write a function `gamma(n)` which takes a positive integer n as input, and outputs the difference between the harmonic sum $\\frac{1}{1} + \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{3} + \\cdots + \\frac{1}{n}$ and the natural logarithm $\\log(n)$.  Use [`numpy`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/) to compute the logarithm, by using the command `from numpy import log` in a separate cell.  Approximate $\\gamma(n)$ as $n \\rightarrow \\infty$.  How large does $n$ need to be to get five digits of precision on this limit?  Can you prove that the limit $\\lim_{n \\rightarrow \\infty} \\gamma(n)$ exists?\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  Modify the `Euclidean_algorithm` function to create a function which returns the *number of steps* that the Euclidean algorithm requires, i.e., the number of divisions-with-remainder.  How does the number of steps compare to the size of the input numbers?  \n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    def Euclidean_algorithm(a,b):\n",
    "    dividend = a\n",
    "    divisor = b\n",
    "    while divisor != 0:   # Recall that != means \"is not equal to\".\n",
    "        quotient = dividend // divisor\n",
    "        remainder = dividend % divisor\n",
    "        print(f\"{dividend} = {quotient} ({divisor}) + {remainder}\")\n",
    "        dividend = divisor  \n",
    "        divisor = remainder\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  When $a$ and $b$ are integers, $GCD(a,b) \\cdot LCM(a,b) = ab$.  Use this fact to write an LCM-function.  Try to make your function output only integers (not floats) and behave in a good way even if $a,b$ are zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  Challenge:  Write a function `approximate_e(n)` which approximates $e$ with a maximum error of $10^{-n}$.  (You can assume $n < 1000$ if necessary.)  Try a while loop and `import mpmath`.  Back up your work often! "
