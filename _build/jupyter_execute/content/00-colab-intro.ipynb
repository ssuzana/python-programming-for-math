    "After you have created a new notebook, you will see an empty code cell. Python code can be entered into these code cells and executed at any time by either clicking the Play button to the left of the code cell or by pressing **Command/Ctrl+Enter**.  At the top of your notebook, there are two buttons: `+ Code` and `+ Text`. Clicking `+ Code` allows you to insert a new code cell, while clicking `+ Text` lets you add a text cell to your notebook. Note that the Google Colab Notebook will need to connect to a Runtime in order to execute any code.\n",
